## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable requires careful attention to structure, organization, and documentation. For Project One, I developed a CRUD Python module that encapsulated all database interactions for MongoDB. By centralizing create, read, update, and delete functionality in a single module, I ensured that all parts of the dashboard could interact with the database in a consistent and predictable manner. This approach promotes maintainability because future developers, or even myself, can update database logic in one place without needing to modify multiple sections of the dashboard code. Readability was enhanced through clear function names, consistent formatting, and detailed docstrings explaining the purpose and expected inputs/outputs of each function. Adaptability was achieved by designing the module to handle general queries and filters, making it reusable for future projects or extensions, such as adding new dashboards, integrating additional data sources, or connecting to other web applications.

The advantage of using this modular approach was that it separated concerns between the database logic and the dashboard presentation. This separation allowed me to focus on designing interactive features without worrying about the underlying data retrieval, resulting in cleaner, more robust code. In the future, this CRUD module could be reused to create additional dashboards, support automated reporting, or integrate with APIs for data ingestion, making it a versatile tool for any project that relies on structured data management.

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by first analyzing the requirements and constraints, then breaking the problem down into smaller, manageable components. For the Grazioso Salvare project, I began by reviewing the dashboard specifications and understanding the types of queries the client needed, such as filtering dogs by rescue type and breed. I mapped out how the dashboard’s interactive options would connect to the database through the CRUD module, following the MVC design pattern to separate the model, view, and controller responsibilities. This structured approach allowed me to plan the flow of data from MongoDB to the dashboard widgets and ensured that updates from filters would propagate correctly across all components.

This project differed from previous assignments because it required end-to-end integration of database design, Python development, and UI/UX considerations. Unlike isolated programming exercises, I had to consider usability for a non-technical client, optimize for dynamic interactions, and ensure maintainability for future updates. Moving forward, I would continue to leverage modular design, thorough documentation, and incremental testing when creating databases for other clients. Techniques like indexing key fields, planning for scalability, and using standardized query functions will ensure that the database meets performance, usability, and adaptability requirements for any project.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists design, develop, and optimize software systems that solve real-world problems by leveraging technology. Their work involves not only writing code but also creating structured approaches to store, retrieve, and analyze data efficiently. In this project, my work enabled Grazioso Salvare to quickly identify dogs suitable for specific types of rescue training, providing actionable insights that directly support their operational mission. By building a dashboard with interactive filtering, dynamic data tables, and visualizations, I helped translate complex data into an intuitive interface that staff can use effectively, improving decision-making and reducing errors.

This type of work matters because it allows organizations to make data-driven decisions, streamline workflows, and achieve goals more efficiently. For a company like Grazioso Salvare, having a dashboard that can filter by rescue type or preferred breeds means that their team can allocate resources better, focus on dogs with the highest potential for training success, and ultimately save more lives. Computer scientists contribute value by bridging the gap between raw data and actionable intelligence, ensuring that technology not only works but also has a meaningful impact on the organization’s mission.
